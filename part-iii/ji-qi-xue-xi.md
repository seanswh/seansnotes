吴恩达的斯坦福《机器学习》

第一周：  
1.机器学习定义。  
两种定义：  
1）the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed。这个定义较为传统，且非正式  
2）A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E。这个定义较为符合现代机器学习的定义。  
**Example**: playing checkers.  
E = the experience of playing many games of checkers  
T = the task of playing checkers.  
P = the probability that the program will win the next game.

机器学习分为2类:监督学习和非监督学习.  
2.监督学习

In supervised learning, we are given a data set and already know what our correct output should look like, having the idea that there is a relationship between the input and the output.
