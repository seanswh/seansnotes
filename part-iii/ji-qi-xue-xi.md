吴恩达的斯坦福《机器学习》

第一周：
1.机器学习定义。
两种定义：
1）the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed。这个定义较为传统，且非正式
2）A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E。这个定义较为符合现代机器学习的定义。
**Example**: playing checkers.
E = the experience of playing many games of checkers
T = the task of playing checkers.
P = the probability that the program will win the next game.

In general, any machine learning problem can be assigned to one of two broad classifications:
监督学习和非监督学习.
2.监督学习
