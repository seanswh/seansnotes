#Word Clouds
    #Word clouds (also known as text clouds or tag clouds) work in a simple way: the more a specific word appears in a source of textual data (such as a speech, blog post, or database), the bigger and bolder it appears in the word cloud.
    #Luckily, a Python package already exists in Python for generating word clouds. The package, called word_cloud was developed by Andreas Mueller. You can learn more about the package by following this link.
