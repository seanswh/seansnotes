#Histograms
#A histogram is a way of representing the frequency distribution of numeric dataset. The way it works is it partitions the x-axis into bins, assigns each data point in our dataset to a bin, and then counts the number of data points that have been assigned to each bin. So the y-axis is the frequency or the number of data points in each bin. Note that we can change the bin size and usually one needs to tweak it so that the distribution is displayed nicely.
