#A box plot is a way of statistically representing the distribution of the data through five main dimensions:

    #Minimun: Smallest number in the dataset.
    #First quartile: Middle number between the minimum and the median.
    #Second quartile (Median): Middle number of the (sorted) dataset.
    #Third quartile: Middle number between median and maximum.
    #Maximum: Highest number in the dataset.
#To make a box plot, we can use kind=box in plot method invoked on a pandas series or dataframe.
