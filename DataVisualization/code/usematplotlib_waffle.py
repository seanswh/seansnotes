#Waffle Charts 
    #A waffle chart is an interesting visualization that is normally created to display progress toward goals. It is commonly an effective option when you are trying to add interesting visualization features to a visual that consists mainly of cells, such as an Excel dashboard.
# let's create a new dataframe for these three countries 
df_dsn = df_can.loc[['Denmark', 'Norway', 'Sweden'], :]
print(df_dsn)
#Unfortunately, unlike R, waffle charts are not built into any of the Python visualization libraries. Therefore, we will learn how to create them from scratch.
# compute the proportion of each category with respect to the total

#Step 1. The first step into creating a waffle chart is determing the proportion of each category with respect to the total.
total_values = sum(df_dsn['Total'])

print(category_proportions)
# print out proportions
for i, proportion in enumerate(category_proportions):
    print (df_dsn.index.values[i] + ': ' + str(proportion))

#Step 2. The second step is defining the overall size of the waffle chart.
width = 40 # width of chart
height = 10 # height of chart
total_num_tiles = width * height # total number of tiles

print ('Total number of tiles is ', total_num_tiles)
#Step 3. The third step is using the proportion of each category to determe it respective number of tiles

# compute the number of tiles for each catagory
tiles_per_category = [round(proportion * total_num_tiles) for proportion in category_proportions]
â€‹
# print out number of tiles per category
for i, tiles in enumerate(tiles_per_category):
    print (df_dsn.index.values[i] + ': ' + str(tiles))
#Step 4. The fourth step is creating a matrix that resembles the waffle chart and populating it.
