## Bar Charts
A bar plot is a way of representing data where the length of the bars represents the magnitude/size of the feature/variable. Bar graphs usually represent numerical and categorical variables grouped in intervals.

##Pie Charts 
A pie chart is a circualr graphic that displays numeric proportions by dividing a circle (or pie) into proportional slices. You are most likely already familiar with pie charts as it is widely used in business and media.

##Box Plots 
A box plot is a way of statistically representing the distribution of the data through five main dimensions:

Minimun: Smallest number in the dataset.
First quartile: Middle number between the minimum and the median.
Second quartile (Median): Middle number of the (sorted) dataset.
Third quartile: Middle number between median and maximum.
Maximum: Highest number in the dataset.

##Scatter Plots
A scatter plot (2D) is a useful method of comparing variables against each other. Scatter plots look similar to line plots in that they both map independent and dependent variables on a 2D graph. While the datapoints are connected together by a line in a line plot, they are not connected in a scatter plot. The data in a scatter plot is considered to express a trend. With further analysis using tools like regression, we can mathematically calculate this relationship and use it to predict trends outside the dataset.

##Bubble Plots 
A bubble plot is a variation of the scatter plot that displays three dimensions of data (x, y, z). The datapoints are replaced with bubbles, and the size of the bubble is determined by the third variable 'z', also known as the weight.
