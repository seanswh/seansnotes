Line Pots

**What is a line plot and why use it?**

A line chart or line plot is a type of plot which displays information as a series of data points called 'markers' connected by straight line segments. It is a basic type of chart common in many fields. Use line plot when you have a continuous data set. These are best suited for trend-based visualizations of data over a period of time.
