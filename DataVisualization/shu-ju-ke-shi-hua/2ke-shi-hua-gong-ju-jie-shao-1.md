由于Pandas与Python的Matplotlib无缝连接，因此，在本课程中默认使用了Pandas读取数据，Matplotlib用来显示pandas中的数据，而且本课程对Pandas的Dataframe进行了较为细致的介绍。

**Line Pots**

What is a line plot and why use it?

A line chart or line plot is a type of plot which displays information as a series of data points called 'markers' connected by straight line segments. It is a basic type of chart common in many fields. Use line plot when you have a continuous data set. These are best suited for trend-based visualizations of data over a period of time.

**Area Plots**

Area Graphs are Line Graphs but with the area below the line filled in with a certain colour or texture. Area Graphs are drawn by first plotting data points on a Cartesian coordinate grid, joining a line between the points and finally filling in the space below the completed line.

**Histograms**
A histogram is a way of representing the frequency distribution of numeric dataset. The way it works is it partitions the x-axis into bins, assigns each data point in our dataset to a bin, and then counts the number of data points that have been assigned to each bin. So the y-axis is the frequency or the number of data points in each bin.
