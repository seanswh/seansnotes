如下图所示，Matplotlib有三个层次：

Now Matplotlib's architecture is composed of three main layers: the back-end layer, the artist layer where much of the heavy lifting happens and is usually the appropriate programming paradigm when writing a web application server, or a UI application, or perhaps a script to be shared with other developers, and the scripting layer, which is the appropriate layer for everyday purposes and is considered a lighter scripting interface to simplify common tasks and for a quick and easy generation of graphics and plots. 

The **back-end layer** has three built-in abstract interface classes: FigureCanvas, which defines and encompasses the area on which the figure is drawn. Renderer, an instance of the renderer class knows how to draw on the figure canvas. And finally, event, which handles user inputs such as keyboard strokes and mouse clicks.

**Artist layer** is composed of one main object, which is the artist. The artist is the object that knows how to take the Renderer and use it to put ink on the canvas. Everything you see on a Matplotlib figure is an **artist instance**. There are two types of Artist objects. The first type is the primitive type, such as a line, a rectangle, a circle, or text. And the second type is the composite type, such as the figure or the axes. The top-level Matplotlib object that contains and manages all of the elements in a given graphic is the figure artist, and the most important composite artist is the axes because it is where most of the Matplotlib API plotting methods are defined, including methods to create and manipulate the ticks, the axis lines, the grid or the plot background. Now it is important to note that each composite artist may contain other composite artists as well as primitive artists. So a figure artist for example would contain an axis artist as well as a rectangle or text artists.
