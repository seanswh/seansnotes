1.正则表达式定义
A regular expression, regex or regexp (sometimes called a rational expression) is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. Usually such patterns are used by string searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings, or for input validation. It is a technique developed in theoretical computer science and formal language theory.

The key to regular expressions is that instead of programming with lines, you're programming actually with characters.
